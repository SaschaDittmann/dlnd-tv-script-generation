# Generate TV Scripts using RNNs in PyTorch
This repo contains my solution of project 4 of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree™️](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program.

It is implemented by using the PyTorch library.

**Please check out Udacity's original repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation)**

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
